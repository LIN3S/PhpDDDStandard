# Front-end stuff
The `Assets` directory contains all the code and assets related with the front. It has **Sass** as CSS preprocessor
and **ES2015** as JavaScript version. These assets and code need to compile as the following way:
```bash
$ cd src/App/Infrastructure/Ui/Assets
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```
All the resultant code is generated inside the `build` directory.
